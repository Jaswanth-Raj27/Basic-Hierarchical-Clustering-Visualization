 It is a part of unsupervised learning
 It is of two types
 -> Agglomerative (aka Top down cluster)
 -> Divisive (aka Bottom up cluster)

 Both the above algorithm can be done using 2 libraries
  > sklearn
  >scipy

 Notes:
   > All above algorithm will bbe in the form of tree like structure
   > Tree like structure can be represented using Dendogram
   > Dendogram can be drawn by only by using scipy
   > This algorithm also works based upon  distance
   > While using scipy we have to use various linkage mechanism for clustering.
      > Single Linkage
      > Complete Linkage
      > Average Linkage
      > Ward Linkage
